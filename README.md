# Advent of Code 2024 in OCaml

![meme](./image.png "literally me on the right")

My attempts and solutions to doing AoC2024 in Ocaml

For my personal structure flow, solutions and puzzle inputs will be stored in `./lib/puzzles` and divided into each day they're opened in. 
Not gonna include my puzzle inputs in the remote repository though because it's not allowed :/.
